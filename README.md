These are details about our CS 4750 project.

Database Overview: We created a relational database for futbol, or soccer called 'SoccerDB'. Spanning the past 2 decades, this database contains information 
about current and past players, teams, leagues, match statistics, and player statistics. Our database was created on Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio
(MSSMS) connecting through a localhost.

APIs: Using Flask and Python to connect to our database and create APIs, our code in flaskConnect.py has GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE APIs for the following
tables: Player, GameMatch, League, PlayerStatistics, and Teams. These handle the creation, reading, removal, and update of data within the database. Postman
was used to properly verify the functions of the written APIs.
